Todo Backbone Example:
--

Shamelessly based on this exercise:
http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/#exercise-1-todos---your-first-backbone.js-app

Goals:
Let’s consider the application’s architecture at a high level. We’ll need:

a Todo model to describe individual todo items
a TodoList collection to store and persist todos
a way of creating todos
a way to display a listing of todos
a way to edit existing todos
a way to mark a todo as completed
a way to delete todos
a way to filter the items that have been completed or are remaining
